## Changelog

**v1.0.0**

This is an initial version of the Fogpad port, a cross-platform audio plugin.

This distinguishes from upstream Fogpad in some ways:
- adopted a version numbering scheme
- implemented portably on top of the DISTRHO plugin framework
- changed sample rate to no longer be a global variable of the plugin
- fixed a bug which disregards the host sample rate, running the effect as default 44.1 kHz
